NOTES:
1. At the moment, will have to jockey path variables within the python scripts and main.cpp depending on the location of the ox_cluster dir.

2. To compile main.cpp on the razor cluster make sure you have loaded the intel compiler & MPI modules. 
   To load these (assuming gcc is preloaded): 
        `module unload gcc; 
         module load intel; 
         module load openmpi; 
         module refresh;`
   You can them run: `mpic++ main.cpp`
