# ANALYSIS & BUILDING:
# --> a) get NBs and strands into data structures
#
# --> b) use position vectors to orientate strands on NB
#
# --> c) from strands bound to a specific NB, show which NBs can bind together
#        maybe do it several levels deep s.t. you can get several NBs bound together to check constructions
#
# --> d) for one analysis option get NPs and strands into condensed from, say G(V, E)
#        where the vertex set is the NPs and the edge set is the connecting strands
#        ->In terms of traditional graph algorithms can find connected components, etc. 
#        ->Can also check for 'trapped' strands where two strands are locked in by bound edges
#          but these strands cannot possibly bind 


# MAIN METHOD 
# a) main dict of functions, can call function based on argv[] list
