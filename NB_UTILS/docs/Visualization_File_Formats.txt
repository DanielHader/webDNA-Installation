overview of oxDNA files used during nBLOCK visualization with UCSF chimera:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

.dat & .conf 
------------
    Files ending in either .dat & .conf are (usually) equivalent as far 
    as oxDNA is concerned. The first three lines of the file contain
    data on the simulation space itself: 
        1. time step
        2. length of the box sides (Lx, Ly, Lz) 
        3. total, potential, and kinetic energies (Etot, U, K) 
    
    Starting from the fourth line each row contains five vectors 
    corresponding to a single nucleotide or nanoparticle within the 
    simulation space: 
        v1. center of mass
        v2. orientation: backbone
        v3. orientation: normal
        v4. velocity
        v5. angular velocity

    Currently while simulating nBLOCK interactions the .dat / .conf
    files output by oxDNA maintain the same format as standard 
    simulations. If you'd like more detailed information consult
    the official documentation on the oxDNA wiki.

.top
----
    The .dat file doesn't contain the necessary information regarding 
    the nanoparticle to strand, strand to nucleotide ownership hierarchy.
    This missing information can be found within a topology file (.top). Also 
    within the .top file is the nucleic acid type of each nucleotide.
    The first line of the file contains two integer values: the total number
    of particles (number of nucleotides + number of nanoparticles) and 
    the total number of strands.

    Then each row contains the following information for each nucleotide:
        1. nanoparticle id
        2. strand id
        3. nucleic acid type
        4. -3 end
        5. -5 end

SUMMARY
---------------------------------------------------------------
x.dat.pdb, x.dat.com      = pyVisScript( x.dat, x.top )
your nBLOCK visualization = UCSFchimera( x.dat.pdb, x.dat.com )
---------------------------------------------------------------
    So we take the native oxDNA files (.dat, .top) and transform them into 
    two other file types that can be opened up with UCSF Chimera. 
    The .pdb (protein data base) file type is a worldwide standard with
    numerous sources of documentation. If you are curious about modifying
    some of the parameters of the .pdb file that is produced by our nBLOCK 
    visualization scripts (e.g. to change the standard AU nanoparticle 
    type to another of your choosing) consult the .txt file 'pdb-format-reference'.
    within the docs directory. This file will give you a jumping off 
    point with the .pdb file format. 

    **The resulting .pdb file doesn't represent DNA at the atomistic
    level, but rather at the same level of abstraction/granularity that oxDNA
    operates at in general.** 

    '.com' is short for 'commands'. This file format is native to Chimera and
    parameterizes particle/molecule visualization options (color, texture, size,
    particle to particle bonds, etc). The developers of Chimera maintain 
    thorough documentation available from their main website.


Quick note to developers 
------------------------
    In the standard .conf and .top file formats you can assume that after 
    accounting for the differences in the number of lines reserved for 
    the header (three for .conf, one for .top) that the ith row of one file 
    is paired with ith row of the other file and that together they 
    give all of the pertinent information for the ith nucleotide. 

    When simulating nBLOCKs the standard indexing scheme isn't maintained. 
    While there is a row in the .conf file for each nanoparticle, there 
    isn't a paired row in the topology file.

    The nBLOCK visualization scripts were adapted from the
    standard oxDNA scripts that serve the same purpose.
